# EyesToMouse
We can use human eyes instead of mouse with this project.
## Installation
### For windows users
(run those in command prompt/cmt/terminal)
For the robot to perform image processing
`pip install opencv`

For media streaming and cross-platforms
`pip install mediapipe`

To simulate mouse cursor moves and clicks , also for keyboard button presses
`pip install pyautogui`

### For linux users
Learn all the above commands on terminal. Make sure to use `pip3`, because in linux `pip` refers for `python2` and `pip3` refers to `python3`.
